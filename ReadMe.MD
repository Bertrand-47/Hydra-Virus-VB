This is an Annoying Program based on "You're an Idiot" Js Virus, Implemented in Visual Basic.
The Project has 10 identical forms with one button captioned "Kill the Process". when the button is clicked it call all other forms
to be displayed on a random place on the screen.
It as "You are an Idiot music in the Background".

It's not a "Virus" at all. it doesn't do any damage to the system. It create those annoying forms which can't be minimized with 
a louder "you are an idio" music.
